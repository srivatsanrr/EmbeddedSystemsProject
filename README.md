# EmbeddedSystemsProject
Project Repository for the Embedded Systems Course Spring 2022. Design of magic curtain (invisible cloak) using system verilog and c++ to deploy in Cyclone V FPGA.
It's not easy for everyone to fly around on a broomstick but we want to show that it may be possible for one to hide oneself up and remain invisible atleast on video.
